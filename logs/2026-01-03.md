- What *clicked* today?
  - when I listened I thought it is difficult. Today I understand one algorithm mostly.
- What changed in your understanding?
  - bitwise operator are small concepts but these are useful when efficiency matters and in hashing also
- What would you explain differently now?

# Still Confusing

List **up to 3 things** that are still unclear.

- What almost makes sense but doesn’t fully?
  - I saw one bitwise operator '>>>' it is so confused me today

- What feels fragile in your understanding?

Rules:
- Questions must be specific

- A REPL experiment
- A minimal snippet
- A variation of today’s code

# One-Sentence Summary

Finish this sentence:

> Today was useful because I made one hashing algorithm. It is giving fixed size output and there are so many collosions. I am happy because I succeed one step that is giving fixed size output.
